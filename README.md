# Expo CLI Intermittent Build Failures

This repository demonstrates a problem with the Expo CLI where build processes fail intermittently, providing little to no helpful error messages. The issue occurs inconsistently, making it challenging to reproduce and debug reliably.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Attempt to build the project using `expo build:ios` or `expo build:android`. Note that the build may succeed or fail on different attempts.

## Potential Causes and Solutions (Speculative)

* **Caching issues:** Clearing the Expo cache (`expo prebuild --clean`) might help resolve the problem.
* **Network connectivity:** Unstable network connections may contribute to build errors. Ensure a stable connection during the build process.
* **Expo CLI version:** Consider upgrading to the latest version of the Expo CLI to benefit from bug fixes and improvements.
* **Underlying dependency issues:** Check for problems with project dependencies. Ensure all packages are up-to-date and compatible.
* **Corrupted project files:** It's possible that corrupted project files may be causing the build failures. Consider creating a new project and transferring the source code.
