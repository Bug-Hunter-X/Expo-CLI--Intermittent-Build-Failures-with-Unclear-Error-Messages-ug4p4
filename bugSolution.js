After trying several solutions and investigating similar issues reported on the Expo community forums, it turned out that the problem was likely related to temporary network instability, which would cause interruptions during the build process. While there isn't a guaranteed fix for intermittent network issues, several steps can mitigate the problem: 

1. **Ensure Stable Network:** Use a reliable internet connection during the build process. Avoid using public Wi-Fi or connections prone to frequent drops.
2. **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism in the build script to automatically retry the build process several times in case of failure. This might help overcome minor temporary network glitches. 
3. **Clear Expo Cache:** Use `expo prebuild --clean` before each build attempt to ensure there is no leftover corrupted cache from previous builds.
4. **Check Dependencies:** Use `npm outdated` or `yarn outdated` to identify outdated dependencies and update them to the latest versions. Consider locking down versions to avoid dependency conflicts.
